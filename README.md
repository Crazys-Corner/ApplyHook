# ApplyHook

## What is it?

ApplyHook is an Open Source application software written in PHP, JS & Bootstrap. It is perfect for game server owners to hire their staff teams, development teams and managers. 

## How do I use it?

First, go to 

``yourdomain.com/path/to/setup.php``

Fill out the form data by setting up a [Discord Webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)

Copy the webhook URL, paste it into the Webhook URL Input box. 

Input your server's branding. This shows up at the top left of the page, across all pages. 

You should be good to go now. Publish it to your users, have them fill out forms, and watch them come in via a webhook, straight to you! 

# Final

Please note that even though this is open source, please don't remove the footers at the bottom, I worked relatively hard on this, and would like some recognition, all for zero cost to you. 

Please don't redistribute as a paid software, that's scummy.

Thanks!
