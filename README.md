# ApplyHook

## What is it?

ApplyHook is a free and Open Source web-app used for Game Server Applications to help server owners with hiring staff teams! It is written in PHP, Vanilla JS, Bootstrap 5 and of course, HTML

## Features

- Applications go to a designated Webhook you set on discord
- You can choose the branding when running the setup script!

## How do I use it?

First, go to 

``yourdomain.com/path/to/setup.php`` (Depends where you upload the files)

Fill out the form data by setting up a [Discord Webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)

Copy the webhook URL, paste it into the Webhook URL Input box. 

Input your server's branding. This shows up at the top left of the page, across all pages. 

You should be good to go now. Publish it to your users, have them fill out forms, and watch them come in via a webhook, straight to you! 

# Final

Please note that even though this is open source, please don't remove the footers at the bottom, I worked relatively hard on this, and would like some recognition, all for zero cost to you. 

Please don't redistribute as a paid software, that's scummy. 

If you would like to see the website's front end example head [here](https://applyhook.civilhost.net)

Note: I don't actively maintain this unless I have a reason to be using it, I am currently working on a close-source (probably) version that's a lot more intuitive for [CivilHost](https://civilhost.net).

Thanks!
