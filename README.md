# Form Webhook Application App

Used to apply for staff, management and development roles on my server, however you can modify the code for whatever reasons you may need. 

## To use

I suggest using Apache and making a .htaccess file. Inside the .htaccess file, do 

``` SetEnv DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL URL ```

Or, make an environmental variable with the name of 

``` DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL ``` 

with the value equating to the URL of your discord webhook. It will work.
